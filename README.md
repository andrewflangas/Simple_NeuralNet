# Simple_NeuralNet
This simple neural network is trained on the X and y data using the backpropagation algorithm. After training, it uses the network to make predictions on a new
test input by setting the `nn.input` to the test data and then calling the `nn.feedforward()` method.

This project requres numpy:

`pip install numpy`
